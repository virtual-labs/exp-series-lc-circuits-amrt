      "question": "Six volts is applied to a 2 ohm resistor in series with two 2 ohm resistors connected in parallel. The current through the first resistor is",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.5 A",
        "b": "3 A",
        "c": "2 A",
        "d": "1 A"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too low; I = 6/3 = 2 A.",
        "b": "Too high; check total resistance.",
        "c": "Correct. Parallel of 2Ω and 2Ω = 1Ω; total R = 2Ω + 1Ω = 3Ω; I = 6/3 = 2 A.",
        "d": "Too low; underestimates current."

      "question": "Which circuit law states that the sum of all currents into and out of a node equals zero?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Chebyshev's Current Law.",

        "c": "Norton's Current Law.",
        "d": "Lenz's Current Law."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Chebyshev’s theorem relates to approximation theory.",
        "b": "Correct. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) applies at nodes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Norton’s theorem relates to equivalent circuits.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Lenz’s law relates to electromagnetic induction."
