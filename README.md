### About the Experiment 

In a series LC circuit, the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) are connected in series with an AC source. The inductive reactance increases with frequency, while the capacitive reactance decreases. At a specific frequency called the resonant frequency, these reactances cancel each other out, resulting in minimal impedance and maximum current. A series LC circuit at resonance also exhibits voltage magnification across the inductor and capacitor.
