      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too high; would require only 1Ω of total resistance.",
        "b": "Too low; total resistance is 4Ω, so I = 5/4.",
        "c": "Too high; recheck resistance and Ohm’s law.",
        "d": "Correct. Total resistance = 2Ω + 2Ω = 4Ω; I = 5/4 = 1.25 A."

        "a": "2.5 A",

        "c": "1 A",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect; underestimates current. Total R = 1Ω.",
        "b": "Incorrect; this is for series configuration.",
        "c": "Incorrect; check parallel resistance.",
        "d": "Correct. Parallel resistance = 1Ω; I = 5/1 = 5 A."
